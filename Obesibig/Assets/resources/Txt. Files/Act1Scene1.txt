Dr. Big: Today is my first day as an surgical oncologist.
Dr. Big: My first patient is a man with lung cancer, caused by years of smoking.
 
Nurse: You're late Dr. Big, this better be the first and last time.
Dr. Big: Sorry for my tardiness, where's the patient?
Nurse: Inside, waiting on his operation. Get in there and we will get started right away.
