Where am I? Damn, I shouldn't randomly walk around aimlessly outside so often... I guess I need to tap the screen to make this text go away...
Looks like I have legs! Which means that by pressing the left or right button I will most probably move!
I need to find somebody, I think I see a house in the distance.
