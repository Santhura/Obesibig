???: Greetings, me...
What the....
Holy shit you look just like me!
???: That's because I am you, from the future!
Why do you have no legs?
future Bloesman: Because in the future, we have no neccesity of legs, that's how advanced we are!
Oh.. uhhh okay... So what else is there in the future? Did we cure cancer?
future Bloesman: no, but only because we were very busy with something way more important!
really? did a new epidemic break out or something? or a 3rd world war?
future Bloesman: What? no, none of that! We were investing all our science into leggless human life! Now we are capable of floating!
seriously? what about diseases? what about space travel? what the fuck man?
future Bloesman: I wouldn't expect you to understand, after all, I thought the same way at first.
okay dude whatever, don't expect me to invest in science then.
future Bloesman: I bet you wish you were legless right now so you wouldn't have to walk 500 miles to your house.

Soo... Will yu help me get there?
future Bloesman: lol, no.
But!
future Bloesman: Bye!
